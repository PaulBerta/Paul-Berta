### [[Toxicity]]
When competitive play comes in to play, elo comes in to play. That means when a player loses a ranked match they will lose elo and that builds frustration which ads up very quickly.

A good way to handle toxicity is punishment and/or friendly reminders that teamwork is essential in competitive games. Maybe find a way to reward players that are friendly.
