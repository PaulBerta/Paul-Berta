- **Introduction**
	- In the introduction the author explains how a issue that a lot of content creators face is starting on a "blank page", a state that is surprisingly hard to get through.
		- A good solution to this problem would be taking smart notes, because if you already have accumulated knowledge on the specific topic that you want to write about/build on, you'll never start on a "blank page"
			- > "Everybody is motivated when the finish line is in reach."
	- The book states that planning(when it comes to learning and note taking) is detrimental because it lets us rely on willpower.
		- Example: The plan of learning an entire chapter in 2 weeks in order to take that exam. 
			- In this example learning new insights and becoming a master in the domain that you are interested in are not the main focus, therefore the upcoming 2 weeks of learning are viewed like a burden, so you will feel relieved once you get past them. 
- **Zettelkasten pros**
	- By having a [[Zettelkasten]] it is easier(maybe guaranteed) to generate new interesting insights and new ideas regarding your domain(or other domains), therefore it will be more appealing to work towards fulfilling those ideas.
	- > "Success is not the result of willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place" - See [[S- Atomic Habbits]]
	- There is very small chance of us learning/encountering only the information that we are looking for, but other pieces of knowledge might generate different types of insights or ideas and it will be a shame to let them go to waste. We should take notes of everything that we find interesting and resonates with us even if they don't fit in our current projects.
		- People rarely focus on a single project at a time so it is beneficial to being receptive to new ideas. This is also a more flexible approach, referring back to the willpower statement made earlier
	- > [[A good tool should't have to many features]], instead it should reduce the distraction so the user can focus on important aspects of the system/product.
- **Typical mistakes regarding note taking:**
	- People take to many "fleeting notes"/bad quality notes 
		- this is detrimental in the long run because the more (unlinked and unpolished)notes you have, the harder it will be to manage and find the relevant information
	- Taking notes only regarding the "active" project(s)
		- This can lead to missing upon adding quality information to your zettelkasten
			- that information could be useful in other contexts(can link to other already existing notes in order to generate new understandings), which can lead to new project ideas that you can act on in the future
	- Treating all notes as permanent notes(Recognize value)
- **Critical mass**
	- To achieve Critical mass we need to establish 3 types of notes:
		- Fleeting notes: this are the notes that usually have a short life(1-2 days), the notes which cover any type of idea that is not thought trough
		- Permanent notes: this are reviewed notes than won't exit our zettelkasten
			- a good way to figure out if a note should be permanent is if you come back to it and still understand what it means and still find the information useful
		- Project notes: This are notes that are related to specific projects
			- This will store anything from ideas,drafts to To Do lists regarding a project
			- This should be stored separately from the permanent notes because they will be discarded/archived after the project is finished
- **[[The feedback loop]]**
	- The zettelkasten provides a feedback loop:
		- When we take literature notes we often find it hard to reproduce what the author said even though we genuinely thought that we did understand what they meant (Did we really understood?)
		- When we go trough our zettelkasten/Slip-box trying to review and link permanent notes we may notice contradictions/repetitions/inconsistency, which highlights the fact that we didn't think that note through
- **[[Multitasking is not a good idea]]**
- **[[The moment we stop making plans is the moment we start to learn]]**
	- By having a step by step plan for doing something, you will indeed learn to follow a step by step plan for doing that specific thing, not to actually do it
		- by stopping to follow a specific guide/plan you start getting a feel for the process
	- this is the way to proficiency
- **Find closure(acceptance)**
	- Our short-time memory is very narrow and it is composed of uncompleted tasks or ideas that are not thought trough, and they fight for our attention
		- In order to free valuable space in our memory we need either to complete our tasks/add information to our long time memory by linking them to already existing knowledge
			- How does this relate to this?
			- Do this two points contradict or complement each other?
			- How does point A prove point B?
			- Based on the knowledge from A and B we can say C.(New understandings)
			- What does A mean for B?
			- >It is easier to remember thing that we understand than things we don't
		- Our brain doesn't know the difference between a completed task and a task which's completion is guaranteed
			- In order for a this to happen we need to write the task down in a way so our brain is convinced that the task will be completed
- **Finding closure in the zettelkasten**
	- Break big and ambiguous writing task in to smaller tasks that can be completed in one go
	- Make sure that everything that comes to mind(every fleeting note) gets written down(Write everything that sparks - you can discard them later anyway)
	- Link your knowledge
	- Review non-permanent notes
- **Reduce the amount of decisions that you should make**
	- This will lead to more clearer workflow
	- By having less decision to make, we create room for thinking about more important problems/tasks
		- A good example would be Bill Gates and Barack Obama who wear only dark blue and gray suits in order to have one less decision to make in the morning 
	- Regarding the zettelkasten this method can be implemented by routine
		- use the same notebook when creating fleeting notes
		- have the same format for your notes
		- review and resume texts in the same manner
- > Breaks are more than opportunities to recover! They are very important in the learning process because allows the brain to process information, move it in the long time memory and prepares it for taking new information.
- **Be open minded**
	- Don't look only for the relevant information/the information that complements your slip-box
		- The contradictory data opens up new connections and discussions
		- >Yes, we have to be selective, but not in terms of pros and cons, but in terms of relevant and irrelevant
- **Learn by practice**
	- In the beginning it taking concise notes and evaluating those wont come very natural, but this skills build up with practice, as long as you focus on improving.
	- >"The one who does the work, does the learning"
- >"If you can't say it clearly, you don't understand it yourself"([[@John Searle]])
	- Often we think that we understood what we read until we try to recreate the information with our own words and understanding.
	- *Recalling the information is also a good practice when it comes to settling information in our long-time memory*
		- This kind of "settling" doesn't necessary have to be remembering the content of a note word by word, but to know enough in order to be able to link it and recall it if you ever need to.
			- More research(in the zettelkasten or outside if there is a gap) can be done afterwards
- **Elaboration is the best learning method**
	- Writing is not the recording of our thinking is where the thinking actually takes place
	- Learning means understanding and what better prof that we understood something then being able to elaborate on that subjects.
		- What does this relate to?
			- Elaboration is making meaningful connections to already existing data in our brains
		- Maybe some examples
		- Do I agree with this? Based on my current knowledge, what are my thoughts?
		- What is missing?
		- Why is it like this?
	- Elaborating on differences and similarities between notes helps categorization and promotes a healthier way of classification
		- Example: A group of student artists were shown one art style at a time then the art style were mixed and shown again in no particular order. The students that encountered the mixed approach were able to spot the different types of art styles easier. 
- *One way of measuring productivity regarding the zettelkasten is the quality notes that you take a day*
- *Try to use key words as labels/make more niche tags*
	- Key words should be assigned regarding on what you are interested in and the topic that you try get information about, not the content of the note alone
	- Marking with smart key words is part of the elaboration process and it leads to better understanding an learning
- **The types of links that are relevant while using a digital slip-box**
	- Entry points
		- This are naturally formed [[Maps of content]]/smart tags(narrower maps of content) which serve as an overview of an already developed topic within the zettelkasten
			- I think it is better to use key words as tags when we create a note if we don't already have a MOC that we know for sure we want to connect it to
				- Maybe MOC should be key words, which can be structured by bigger topics/MOC in the [[000 - HOME]] (this will be decided by testing)
	- Week links
		- This are the links between notes that are related in any kind of way(content wise).
		- This are the links that give birth of new understandings.
			- Example: "How to manage stress" + "Binge eating can be caused by stress" = "Start losing wight by giving less fucks:))"
-  **New ideas don't come like a flash**
	- Firstly, originality is a very subjective thing because most of the times it is our interpretation of someone else's work/output, or a combination (there is no truly original ideas).
	- The "flash" illusion is due to the fact that the big realization/end line of that insight happens very quickly(evrica), but often they are the result of countless hours of brainstorming and thinking towards that specific thing.
	- *Intuition is not the opposite of rationality, because it is the result of all our past learning, which helped to build our conscious!*
		- You shoul'd be afraid to listen to you intuition if you are knowledgeable in the domain (a lot of great discoveries are based on intuition).
- **Abstraction in learning**
	- We often tend to jump to conclusions after we encounter something, especially if we find that resonates with our beliefs(This is the reason why "open minded people" tend have this problem more often).
	- The abstraction factor helps promoting a insight-creating attitude.
		- By putting an information in different contexts we may see different meanings and connections within the slip-box.
		- What is missing?
			- An example that I like is the one of the mathematician Abraham Wald. He was supposed to help the RAF(Royal Air force) find areas on they planes that were usually hit by bullets in order to reinforce them.
				- The mathematician told them to reinforce the parts which were not hit by bullets.
					- The RAF didn't take in account the planes that didn't return.
- **Restrictions promote creativity**
	- By having some well defied restrictions we can reduce the choices that we have on a daily basis in order to let our brain focus on important things.
	- Regarding the creative part, being "forced" to work with a limited amount of resources you will most likely make the most out of them.
		- It also helps us set some boundaries(so we don't feel overwhelmed), because when we have infinite freedom regarding our possibilities we tend to forget our scope 
			- My experience with notion is a good example. I started looking for ways to make my life easier, keeping track of everything(most important things) using databases. At the end of the day I noticed that I was making everything way more complicated that I should, therefore I started to feel overwhelmed by the amount of things that I need to put in my databases, and the overall process felt unnatural.
- **Output from the Zettelkasten**
	- In this phase we are looking to form rough drafts and outlines using the content of our zettelkasten
		- Now we don't need to focus on abstraction, nor to seek connections between notes, because we already did that.
		- We need to think about every note in the context in which the final product will be released
- **Familiarity supports creativity**
	- As the slip-box gets bigger, we notice the domains and the facts that we truly find interesting, the ones we are most familiar with
	- The more familiar we are with a subject the more freedom we have, and therefore the more creative we can be.
		- We can notice its flaws and limitation.
		- We can play with it in different ways.
-  **Act on projects you identify with**
	- It is way easier to act on a project that we are enthusiastic about.
	- Usually, by committing on project upfront is not a good idea because if we aren't familiar enough with it we might not like it that much in the end(it may still be a good project, but it may not be appealing to us), therefore it will be a burden to finish, if it will get finished at all.
		- That is why the zettelkasten is a good consultant when it comes to "what projects do we need to do?"
			- By having a lot of information connected under a certain context we can consider releasing something based on that.
- **Overconfidence problem**
	- A lot of the time we overestimate our abilities especially when it comes to getting something done, therefore we rarely meet our deadlines(which are created with good-perfect conditions in mind).
		- Stumbling upon problems/setbacks can be very demotivating when you have unrealistic plans/deadlines
		- Having a more realistic approach and thinking about the preparation and the process itself instead of the end goal can help motivating you.
			- When you know what you have to do it is actually more likely that you are going to do it(you will be more motivated)
			- Having milestones/goals, and specific ones makes working towards completing a project more appealing(easier to act on)
- **Actual writing**
	- >The first draft is only the first draft
		- Having this in mind lifts the pressure of needing to write perfect publish-ready content.
	- *Kill your darlings*
		- Even though it is hard, you have to ditch the points/notes that don't fit that specific reasoning that you associated them with
			- [[@Sonke Ahrens]] talks about having a "rest" folder where he puts the notes that didn't fit so he can place them somewhere else(later in the development)...but obviously they never leave that folder.
- >"The more pressure we fell, the more we tend to stick to out old routines."
	- The tunnel effect
		- "Change is possible when the solution appears to be simple."
