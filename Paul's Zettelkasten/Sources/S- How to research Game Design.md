- **In order for you to be able to say that you did your research you need to:** 
	- Play a lot of games
	- Watch a lot of games(this doesn't work when you need to get a feel for something) - see [[Human factor of the game]]
	- Go through a lot documentation related to the topic.
		- > You already doing one of the biggest parts of game development.(That is playing the game).
		- There is nothing you can do to compensate a lack of genre research.
- **What is [[Game design study]]?**
	- In order to allow yourself to "end your research" regarding a game is playing enough so you can get the feel of what the game has to offer (average is a good goal to set).
	- Key question for studying game design:
		- Is this genre established? Does it have specific characteristics that differentiates it from other genres and that persist among this one?
		- Why people play this genre? What the type of people that play this game like? [[Focus on the community]]
			- What are the foundational elements?
		- What makes it work?
		- What also works in this genre?
		- What doesn't work in this genre?
		- What give me that dopamine rush? What makes me feel good?
		- If you can't answer the questions above you need to play more of that genre(do more research).
- **Play games with an analytical perspective.**
	- Know what are you looking for.
		- With that in mind you can notice if something is wrong withing the first 15 minutes of the gameplay
- **Break games down**
	- What is working in this game?
	- What ingredients they are using?
	- What are the aspects that persist across the genre?
	- How do I make based on the answers to the questions above? What "ingredients" should my game have?
	- What systems/features from other genres complement my "dish" without altering the main gameplay (keep the game in the genre)
- **You don't need to keep day 1 features the same**
	- The hosts were talking about the fact that a lot of developers are doing the mistake of keeping their first tutorial build(which they created at the beginning of the development)in their final game(which may be 6 months or one year after the tutorial was created and there is a great chance that you don't have the same game)
- > You need to understand the rules before you can break them
	- If you try to make a crazy combination of genres or if you want to change the main mechanics in order to brake it, make sure you know what are you working with(be very familiar to the genres)
- **[[Follow trends]]**
	- If someone does a game in your genre and they make it better than you, that would be the new standard
	- Why would someone play my game instead of playing this one?
