# R- Albion online 

#### What is this game about?
- Albion Online is a sandbox MMORPG with Tourchlight-like graphics.
- It is placed in a medieval setting 
- There are no classes -> your builds are based on your equipment.
- Gathering resources is a big part of this game.

#### What are your first impressions?
- I really like the art style of this game, it seems easier/friendlier to make than most of the MMORPG's that I played. 
- The UI text is to small for my taste. I found it hard to read the quests, and I gave up trying pretty fast.

##### What is good?
- I like the fact that the roads that lead to cities look better(made of stone)
- 
##### What is not so good?
- As a new player I faced the problem of "being to heavy"(so I was moving very slow) due to the amount of resources that I was carrying. This happened to me while I was 2 maps away from the main town, where the vault was(which i had no idea about until I discovered it). Overall this was a pretty uncomfortable and unnecessary experience. 
	- A good way to solve this "issue" is to make the player encounter that. situation(of being to heavy) on purpose, and then present the vault(solution) to them.
- I feel lost to many times, and keeping in mind that I played a fair amount of [[MMORPG]] games finding what to do shouldn't feel this hard...(I couldn't find a place to craft armor even after I googled it a little).
	- I think the main thing that the game lacks so far is the teaching(maybe applying[[Ludo narrative harmony]]would be a good idea).
- Another thing that I notice is the lack of player-player interactions. I don't know if this is personal preference bun I would the game to promote this a little bit more because now it seems that they try to hide it.
	- Maybe a quest where you have to get 1 friend...or group quests similar with [[Guild Wars 2]].
	- Maybe small UI changes like making the chat a little bigger and clearer(I have a 25' monitor and the default text it is hard to read).
- I think it would have been helpful to make my "first times" more obvious
	- I was supposed to get out of my first dungeon, and I figured it out by mistake because I wanted to mount, and the actions had the same mapping(you can't mount in the dungeon apparently)

## Ideas(What could make it better?):
