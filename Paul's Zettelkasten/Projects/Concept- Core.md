## Core - Concept 

#### Overview - Description
- This will be a top down 2D Arcade game
- It will be set in space
- The "core" is represented by a planet, which will start out as a star and will grow as you get more points(It will grow until a certain point, then i will change its appearance, maybe some glow or different color/effect)
- You control a type of **shield** which you need to rotate around a **planet(core)** in order to **protect** it **from projectiles**
	- I don't know the type of shield yet. It can be a machine like a space ship but a "energy" one would fit better i think(and would be easier to design)
- **The projectiles** will spawn from a 360 degree angle around the planet and they will fly towards it.
	- There will be 3 types of projectiles
		- **Points:** if they reach the core you will get points, if you block them you will lose points
		- **Damage:** if they reach your core you lose points(and a life point if I decide to add it)
		- (?)**Life:** if your lifes < max lifes then you will get a life, if not, you will get points
		- (?)**Power Ups** you will get a specific power up(maybe they stack/make the power up more effective)
- I am not sure about the way that I should increase the difficulty. Should I only increase the spawn rate and the speed or should I add different patterns for the bullets(I will see as I go, depending on how hard it is to accomplish)*Maybe more patterns after soft launch*
- I am not sure about the amount of power ups that I want to add. I have some ideas:
	- Clear all projectiles
	- Bigger(longer) shield
	- Immune core(maybe it will be immune to damage, maybe damage + lifes so its not only a buff)

##### Other Ideas:
- Think about space // what happens in space( maybe some known phenomenons or events) * they can be related to the story part
- Present the planet and the situation in the tutorial in order to create [[Bounding between player and game]]
- You can implement competitiveness([[Other ways to implement competitiveness]]) by adding a leader board
