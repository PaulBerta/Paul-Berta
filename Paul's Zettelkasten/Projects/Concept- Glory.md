## Glory - Concept 

#### Overview - Description
- This will be a third person/top down game(perspective similar to [[R- Albion online]])
- The arts style will be inspired by the Torchlight series and [[R- Albion online]] 
- It will be a PvP and Team PvP arena game with TFT/HS-Battlegrounds-like round system
	- So there will be PvE, PvP, and neutral rounds
		- **PvE Rounds** -> you will fight mobs in order to gain experience and loot(upgrade items and wearable)
		- **PvP Rounds** -> you will fight other players for **"glory"** which will act ass the Score/Life(When you are left with no glory -> you are kicked out of the arena)
			- In order to keep a match balanced, since there will obviously be a bonus for the players with a lot of glory(won X PvP games), the players that lost a lot of matches can get a **"rage"** bonus that will make them a little bit stronger so they can get back up on the ladder(same principle as the TFT lose streak)
		- **Neutral Rounds** -> ATM I thought only about a **forgery** and a **marketplace**
			- **In the marketplace** - players can buy gear, buffs/potions, and upgrade items
				- A good idea would be to show the crafting recipes in the market UI so they know what upgrade items they need to buy (Make it a choice in settings)
			- **In the forgery** - players can upgrade their items using upgrade items that they dropped from the PvE Rounds/bought from the market

##### Other Ideas:
- Maybe there should be an item or a type of material that makes a character able to wear armor for another class(Obviously that should be affective/worth it somehow) (*See Dragon Age: Inquisition*)
- Mordhau + Albion -> This could be a game mode
