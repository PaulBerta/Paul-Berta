## Zettelkasten 
*This will be your personal assistant when it comes to generating Output*
Method developed by Niklas Luhman(physiologist from Germany)

- The main purpose of the zettelkasten is for you to have all the information that you need(or a good part of it at least), organized, at your disposal when you want to get something out, in order to make the process faster/more appealing/better.
	-  >It is way easier to commit on a project when you have the end line in reach
- It is also a great environment to develop new insights([[New understandings]]) by making the connections between already existing ideas/notes.
	- Creating new insights and getting new ideas makes you more interested in the subject making it more likely for you to work on those ideas without needing willpower (Maybe has something to do with the evrica and [[The dopamine boost]])
- This notes should be [[atomic notes]] because it is easier to establish the connections between them this way. The wider the view, the more overwhelming this process will seem.
- [[Don't be an Archiveist]].
- You can "ask questions" to your zettelkasten. [[Filling the blank spots]]
