## atomic notes 
*This are notes that refer only to one specific thing, but they capture the entirety of that specific thing.*

If you have to broad notes, when you link something to it, there will be a good chance that you will end up with a mess because not every aspect of the broad note may be related to the recently linked note.

If you have to fragmented notes it may be hard to see certain connections.
