## Blank page fear 
- We often hear that the first step is the hardest, and that is not far from the truth.
	- We are more likely to act on something when we have a base and/or if we know exactly what we need to do
- I think of the "blank page" as an analogy for anything that needs to get going.
	- It could be a project,a task, or even a studying session.
- To avoid/get past this effect we can do the following:
	- Prepare in advance.
		- This could be making sure that you know exactly what you need to do.
		- Or make sure that we already have material that supports the project 
			- > "Everybody is motivated when the finish line is in reach."
	- When we talk about studying or work we can use the [[pomodoro]] method until we get in the [[flow state]]
