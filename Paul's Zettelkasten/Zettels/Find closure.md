- Unfinished task tend to clutter our minds(the nature of the task doesn't matter), and they tend to steal our attention from the next tasks.
- In order to "find closure" and clear our mind, we need to finish what we started(don't let them hanging), so we can focus our entire attention to what is coming next.
	- Break big/ambiguous writing tasks in smaller, more manageable ones
	- Get every idea written down(free your mind)
