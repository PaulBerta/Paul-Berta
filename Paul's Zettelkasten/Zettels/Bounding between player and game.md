## Bounding between player and game 
 *A good game should generate emotion!*
*In order to generate emotion we need emotional investment.*

A good way of making the player invest emotion in our game is to create a bound either:
- between the player and main character 
- between the main character(which the player identifies with) and other characters/environment.
