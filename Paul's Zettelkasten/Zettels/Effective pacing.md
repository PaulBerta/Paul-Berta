## Effective pacing 
There should be a clear delimitation between players with different ranks/resources(*Example: cards in Hearthstone*). This is where ELO rating comes to play.

"You don't want to throw new players in to ranked from start, and competitive players don't want to go backwards" 

In order to maintain that progressive complexity you can use clever restrictions 
Examples:
1. LOL lets you play only free(easy) characters at the beginning 
2. Overwatch locks competitive play until you reach a certain level
3. Shadowverse's story mode gives you a tutorial on the basics and individual tutorials for each faction

*Hearthstone is a bad example again, because even though two players are the same rank(24 for example), one maybe played the game for a longer time and has more cards from different expansions, which gives him an unfair advantage*
