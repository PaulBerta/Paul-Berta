## Play games with an analytical perspective 
- Know what are you looking for.
	- With that in mind you can notice if something is wrong withing the first 15 minutes of the gameplay
- Break the game down:
	- What is working in this game?
	- What ingredients are they using?
	- What are the aspects that persist across the genre?
	- How do I make based on the answers to the questions above? What "ingredients" should my game have?
	- What systems/features from other genres complement my "dish" without altering the main gameplay (keep the game in the genre)
