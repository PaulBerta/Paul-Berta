## Creating the zettelkasten 
1. Make fleeting notes.
2. Make literature notes.
3. Make permanent notes.
4. "Add" the permanent notes to the zettelkasten.
	1. "Put a note behind the one which's idea this note is continuing/empowering" - Because of today's tools we can link notes way easier. I link notes in places where their information "fits the gap"/empowers the reasoning.
	2. Link related notes - the way that the notes are related doesn't matter.
	3. Make sure you will find this note later - MOC and outlines work well for that.
5. Develop your topics - [[Filling the blank spots]]
6. Commit on a topic that you want to generate output upon.
7. Turn your notes in to rough drafts - I think [[Maps of content]] achieve this already.
8. Polish and publish your work.
