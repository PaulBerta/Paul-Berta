When we read someones else's work we tend to take that knowledge as it is without refactoring and synthesizing it, process which is on par with repeating what someone else said.
This can be detrimental in the long run because we gent unused to **do our own thinking**

The most obvious antidote to this is to take notes in **your own words**.
