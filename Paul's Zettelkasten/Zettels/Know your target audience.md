## Know your target audience 
*Who is going to play this game?*
Knowing who are making the game for is a must when it comes to game development. Having a target audience can help prevent [[Over scoping]] by providing some design boundaries(If I add this feature will the game remain relevant to the same target audience?).

In order to reach your audience you need to know what that audience looks like. By reaching your audience you can ask for feedback in order to make sure that you make the game that they want to play.

This can help in the [[Monetization]] department too. By knowing what your audience want you can, you can outline their [[Tower of wants]], by doing that you will know what the player would want/need at a certain stage, so you can make appealing shop offers(*That are not greedy or detrimental for the game in the long run*).
