## Toxicity 
When competitive play comes in to play, ELO comes in to play. That means when a player loses a ranked match they will lose ELO and that builds frustration which ads up very quickly. 

It is most likely that the frustration will materialize in a bad attitude, and toxic behavior towards other players(either teammates or enemies)  

Good ways to handle toxicity:
1. punishment (mutes/ temporary bans/ permanent bans)
2. promote a good attitude (friendly reminders that teamwork is essential in competitive games) 
3. find a way to reward players that are friendly.
4. a feature/game mode that makes the players interact in a friendly way(Something that is unavoidable) | Maybe a reward
