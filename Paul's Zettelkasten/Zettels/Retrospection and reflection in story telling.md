### When telling a story think about the background of the subject:
#### For environments:
- How was this created?What was the context?
- What happened there?What it was used for?
- How was the "room" before you got there?
- What is happening there on a day to day basis?

#### For characters:
- Who where they?
- What have they been through?
- What they wanted?
- What they want now?
- What they usually do?
- Why they do what they do?
- What is their relationship with the other characters and how is that influencing the story?

*Example: A character is wearing a bandage on his left arm because some time ago he fought an alligator that ripped his elbow -> Maybe he was an alligator hunter or a survivalist*
