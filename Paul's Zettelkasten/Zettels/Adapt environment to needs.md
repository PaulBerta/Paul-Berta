### Adapt environment to needs 
Answer this questions:
1. What feeling are you trying to induce?
2. What do you want the player to do/use?

You need to create the environment based on the answers of the previous questions. So it should be intuitive for the player to act as you want.

###### Examples:
- If you want the player to use a certain ability you should make it impossible for the player to pass an area/level without using it
	- If you want the player to double jump you can put a big whole before the "finish line"
	- If the player should learn to use an AOE skill, he needs to encounter a big wave of "one shot" enemies (one shot ->[[The dopamine boost]])
- If you wand to induce a certain type of feeling, tension for example, you can create an enemy/mob that "hits from nowhere"(*maybe a dramatic sound track and a darker map*)
	- If you want the player to feel more pressured, think about a narrower room
	- If you want induce joy, try to make a more open space, with some green spaces and a joyful soundtrack
