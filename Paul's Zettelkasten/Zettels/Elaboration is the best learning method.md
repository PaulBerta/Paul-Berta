## Elaboration is the best learning method
- Writing is not the recording of our thinking is where the thinking actually takes place
	- Learning means understanding and what better prof that we understood something then being able to elaborate on that subjects.
		- What does this relate to?
			- Elaboration is making meaningful connections to already existing data in our brains
		- Maybe some examples
		- Do I agree with this? Based on my current knowledge, what are my thoughts?
		- What is missing?
		- Why is it like this?
	- Elaborating on differences and similarities between notes helps categorization and promotes a healthier way of classification
		- Example: A group of student artists were shown one art style at a time then the art style were mixed and shown again in no particular order. The students that encountered the mixed approach were able to spot the different types of art styles easier.
