## Reduce the amount of decisions that you should make 
- One a day to day basis we have to make a decision every few moments. This takes time, and more important, every decisions needs a certain amount of attention depending on its nature.
	- By developing our routine and environment in a way so we don't have to make unnecessary decisions(not as much at least) we let our brain focus on more lucrative matters.
		- A good example would be the approach that Bill Gates and Barrack Obama take to clothing.
			- They have only two types of suites, gray and dark blue. By doing this they don't need to pay to much attention to what kind of suites they should ware due to the limited possibilities.
		- Regarding the [[Zettelkasten]], some ways to implement this principle would be:
			- Using the same notebook/program when you take your notes.
			- Have the same format for them.
			- Review and resume material in the same manner.
