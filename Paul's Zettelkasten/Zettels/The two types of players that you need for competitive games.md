## The two types of players that you need for competitive games
^2daced

1. **Casual** - this group of players that will help create a friendly environment for new players. Having a casual fan base maintains the "low elo" level of play so new comers aren't destroyed by hardcore players (*Battelrite is a good example of that is now how you do it* ) ^10aed6
2. **Hardcore** - this group forms the competitive scene which attracts players, and provides new players with goals to shoot for(*Example: Everyone tries to learn how to play like Faker*) ^f3c7ec
