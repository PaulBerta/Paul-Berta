## Restrictions promotes creativity
- By having some well defied restrictions we can reduce the choices that we have on a daily basis in order to let our brain focus on important things.
	- Regarding the creative part, being "forced" to work with a limited amount of resources you will most likely make the most out of them.
		- It also helps us set some boundaries(so we don't feel overwhelmed), because when we have infinite freedom regarding our possibilities we tend to forget our scope 
			- My experience with notion is a good example. I started looking for ways to make my life easier, keeping track of everything(most important things) using databases. At the end of the day I noticed that I was making everything way more complicated that I should, therefore I started to feel overwhelmed by the amount of things that I need to put in my databases, and the overall process felt unnatural.
