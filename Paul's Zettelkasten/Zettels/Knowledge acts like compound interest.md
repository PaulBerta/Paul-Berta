If you only take [[transient notes]], you will end up with the same amount of notes that you initially wrote.(*Orphan notes that you will most likely forgot about or you wont use*)

If you take smart notes, and you link your knowledge, building [[New understandings]], you will create a more accessible(and bigger) knowledge vault which will serve as support for future work.

The more you learn -> The more you know -> The more you can do -> The more opportunity there is (*Your inventory influences this process a lot*)
