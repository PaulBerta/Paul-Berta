## Game design vs Game UX 
*Game designers define the why's, while the UX designers define the how's.*
Game designers will work on the systems that are present in the game and will set the technical boundaries, while the UX designers will manipulate the way that the player interacts with those systems.

Example:
- A game designer might make a crafting system and set the type of items that you can craft and what items do you need to craft that, while the UX designer will think how to teach the player how to craft, what information should we provide?
