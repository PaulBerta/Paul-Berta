## Digital art cheats 
- Tracing : you will draw above other people's sketches and drawings
	- Trace the illustration, then try to recreate it by yourself a few times
- Steal perspective
- Use 3D models as reference
- Steal color pallets
	- This can be used as reference, you don't need to use the exact same colors but, by using a good color pallet you will be able to see if the drawing is actually good
- Turn of the color(desaturate colors) so you can see if the contrast is good enough so everything is distinguishable
