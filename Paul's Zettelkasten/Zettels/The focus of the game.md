## The focus of the game 
*Is the player challenged in the way that you intended?*

Apart for the specific challenges that the player needs to face(by design), friction should be reduced as much as possible

Examples:
- In Fortnite, the main challenges are shooting, gathering resources and building, there are no recipes for the player to keep in mind(this is feature that could have been added but it was out of the focus of the game)
