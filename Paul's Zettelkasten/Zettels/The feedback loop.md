## The feedback loop 
- There are moments(lots of them) when we don't know if what we are doing is worth our time, if the quality of our work is good/bad.
	- This is where feedback loops come in our help.
		- It helps us figure out how to improve and make our work better
		- The zettelkasten provides feedback loops:
			- When we take literature notes we often find it hard to reproduce what the author said even though we genuinely thought that we did understand what they meant (Did we really understood?)
			- When we go trough our zettelkasten/Slip-box trying to review and link permanent notes we may notice contradictions/repetitions/inconsistency, which highlights the fact that we didn't think that note through
