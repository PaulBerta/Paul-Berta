## What are evergreen notes 
 *This system works hand in hand with the [[Zettelkasten]] method in  order to build knowledge vaults that last.* 
 
 -> It is very easy to take notes that you will forget about. In order to take advantage of any knowledge input, you need to tie it to a specific context and other notes in order to build [[New understandings]].
 
#### Characteristics of evergreen notes:
1. You  should take [[atomic notes]] -> Notes that are small in the sense that they cover one thing at a time, but as much as possible cover the entirety of that thing.
2. Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented(*not book, event, topic, project*) .
3. The author suggests to combine the [[Zettelkasten]] method and the evergreen note system (*link your evergreen notes "densely"*).
4. The author underlines the fact that by organizing notes in a hierarchical(library like) fashion we get weaker pieces of knowledge that are hard to connect to new ones(since they where assigned to a specific topic). -> Let the structure emerge organically
5. Write notes so you can understand! It is pretty hard and time consuming to write an [[atomic notes]] that is "ready to be published". That can make the action of taking notes less appealing.
6. [[Don't be an Archiveist]]
