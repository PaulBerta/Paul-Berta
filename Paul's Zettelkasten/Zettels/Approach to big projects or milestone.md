1. Have a schedule. When should you work on that? Combine scheduling with [[10 Blocks Method]].
2. Be consistent! As you already know, consistency is way more important than perfection!  Think about [[The snowball effect]] .
3. Learn to say no! Know your priorities. (Quit college maybe)
4. Make time for fun, reward yourself.
5. Learn [[managing stress]].
6. Have a positive mindset! If you feel down or if you encounter a hard task, think about the long term goal! Why are you fighting for? (ATM, it can be anything as long as it keeps you motivated)
7. **Focus** on the task ahead of you! Big tasks can feel overwhelming so you should break them in smaller tasks *Example: Don't read 20 pages, read 5+5+5+5 pages*!
