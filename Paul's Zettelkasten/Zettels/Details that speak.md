## Details that speak 
*The environment,music,sound effects, particles etc. should give the player information(make it obvious that something happened or is going to happen)!*

- How do I tell the player that something happened without actually telling him?
- How can I make more clear that something happened?
- "How can i guide him without an arrow?"
- How can I make this feel better? [[The dopamine boost]]

Examples:
1. more blood spilling after a critical hit
2. a previously wounded character is wearing a bandage
3. a flickering light can direct the player
4. a heavy shot blocked generates different sound and visual effects
