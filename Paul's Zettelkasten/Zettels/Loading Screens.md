Loading screens are very good tools when it comes to masking a scene transition but they can be more than that.

- they need to keep the player engaged (*Show some story insights/A photo of the room that you are going to enter/Some lore/Tips to make the gameplay easier or more enjoyable*). Don't lose players attention!
- you can use them to set the mood or to create tension
- you can use them to keep the pacing of the story ([Pillow Shots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhQwFxhiVQs))
