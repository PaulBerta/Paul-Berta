## Be selective regarding what you learn 
- From the desire to learn, at "first hand", every insight of a specific domain, we tend to study what we already know, hoping that we'll see something new.
	- We should consider studying material on the same topic if it seems particularly interesting and useful or maybe if someone who you trust recommends it.
		- By doing this we can be more productive and we also promote an open mindset when it come to ("what should I learn next").
