## How unrelated systems connect?
I think this can be achieved in multiple ways:
- The systems that the player doesn't see but they add up in order to create/maintain the flow of the game
- How can a current mechanic relate to another mechanic?
	- "How is jumping related to exploration/combat" (*Mario jump is a good example*)
