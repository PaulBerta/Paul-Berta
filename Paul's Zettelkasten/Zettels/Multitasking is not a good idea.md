## Multitasking is not a good idea 
- Although the temptation is big(we might get bored and we get our phone or jump from task to task), the effort to concentrate on a single task is worth it because this way we can maximize quality and quantity output 
- A lot of people think that by multitasking they are more productive but in reality they are not(Studies have shown that people that do one task at a time get things done in a shorter period of time and the quality of their work is significantly better)
	- By focusing on one task at a time it is easier to enter and stay in the [[flow state]]
		- In this circumstance you focus on the task in front of you without any effort and for extended periods of time
