## Analog drawing to vector art 
1. Draw your design
2. Digitize your design (You should scan it but I think photos work too)
3. Clean your design( In this phase you should erase any unwanted line/guide)
4. Make the image black for a stronger trace (you don't want to have many gray tones)
5. Trace your design
6. Play with the presets until you are happy with the result
7. Convert your trace into paths
8. Play with your vector art
