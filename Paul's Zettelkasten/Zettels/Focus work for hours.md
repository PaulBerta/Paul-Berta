1. In order to make the task more appealing try to set up a good session the night before/ a few hours before. Nobody likest to start with a "blank page"
2. Try to stay seated as much as possible in so you don't have to enter the focus/work/studying state to many times a day
3. Try to minimize distraction(Especially you phone)
4. Reward yourself(2 hours studied/worked = 45 minutes of free time)
5. Set standards! "You are better than this!". If you worked yesterday for 2 hours straight, that means that you can't stop at 1.5 hours today without a very good reason(matter of urgency)
