## Difference between tags and context
- The difference between a topic and a context lays in the way you think regarding your information when you tag it.
	- Where does this fit?
		- If you ask this question you act like an archivist by assigning the information to a topic.
		- By doing things this way, the as the topic gets more cluttered, your notes will be harder to find, therefore they will eventually get lost.
	- How does this relate to the information that I already have?
		- If you ask this question you promote an open mindset when it comes to note linking(you don't link only notes that are related to one area).
		- By doing this we apply the strongest attribute of the [[Zettelkasten]].
- A good analogy between this two principles is putting money in a bank account VS investing in a fund.
