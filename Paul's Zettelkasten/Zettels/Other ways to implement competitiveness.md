You can implement competitiveness in any area using "best time/score".
Maybe the best time of completing a level/task("You are better than 60% of the players"-> similar with steams achievement system)

*A very good example would be the Titanfall 2 tutorial, which has a "best time" feature, which keeps the player interested and encourages them to replay the tutorial, getting more familiar with the mechanics of the game* - this fits Titanfall nicely but that doesn't mean it will fit your game, think about it.
