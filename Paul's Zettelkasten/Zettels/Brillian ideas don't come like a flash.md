## Brilliant ideas don't come like a flash 
- Firstly, originality is a very subjective thing because most of the times it is our interpretation of someone else's work/output, or a combination (there is no truly original ideas).
	- The "flash" illusion is due to the fact that the big realization/end line of that insight happens very quickly(Evrica), but often they are the result of countless hours of brainstorming and thinking towards that specific thing.
	- *Intuition is not the opposite of rationality, because it is the result of all our past learning, which helped to build our conscious!*
		- You shoul'd be afraid to listen to you intuition if you are knowledgeable in the domain (a lot of great discoveries are based on intuition).
