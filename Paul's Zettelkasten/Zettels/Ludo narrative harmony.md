## Ludo narrative harmony

*Ludo narrative is the story(internal and external) of the game*

The **Ludo narrative harmony** is achieved when the story and the gameplay work together to create a memorable events. 

Examples: 
- The Kiss mission in Shadow of Mordor where you are taught the stealth mechanic so you can surprise your wife, which you(the player) are introduced to.
- In Dragon age: Inquisition you need to invest in your companions("Do companions missions") in order to gain their trust so they will remain your friends(and help you when you need)
	- Companions are also affected by the way you respond to them in [[Dialog options]] 
	- This friendships can change the whole story of the game
