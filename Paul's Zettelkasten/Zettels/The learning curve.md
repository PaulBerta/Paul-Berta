## The learning curve 
In order to get good at a competitive game it is not enough to know the mechanics, you need to be familiar with the current meta(which is constantly changing).

Beginner tutorials teach the mechanics,but if the game has some age, that means the meta is very different and it is a big chance that the tutorial isn't viable(enough)
anymore.

Maybe two types of tutorials, one for complete beginners and one advanced(maybe live) game.

*Hearthstone is a good example of that is not how you do it.*

*Skullgirls is a good example - beginner tutorial -> advanced challenges.*
