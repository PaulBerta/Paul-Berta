## 10 Blocks Method 
This technique suggest assigning a certain amount of time(blocks) for a specific task or project per week.
	Example: He has 10 blocks of 4 hours -> 40 hours = 5 working days times 8 hours a day 

In my opinion this method can be effective if you want to make sure that you spend a certain(enough) amount of hours to a specific area every week.

It is based on the [[Time blocking]].

This method provides a [[The feedback loop]], so every week we find if we allocate as much time as needed on the important areas of our lives.
