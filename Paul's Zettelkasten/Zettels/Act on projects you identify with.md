## Act on projects you identify with 
- It is way easier to act on a project that we are enthusiastic about.
	- Usually, by committing on project upfront is not a good idea because if we aren't familiar enough with it we might not like it that much in the end(it may still be a good project, but it may not be appealing to us), therefore it will be a burden to finish, if it will get finished at all.
		- That is why the zettelkasten is a good consultant when it comes to "what projects do we need to do?"
			- By having a lot of information connected under a certain context we can consider releasing something based on that.
