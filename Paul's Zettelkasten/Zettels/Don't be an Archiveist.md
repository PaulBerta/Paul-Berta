1. *Don't think about where this fits -> try to think about how do you want to meet the same idea in the future
2. *Relating information back to what you already now

The main idea is to connect information in order to make it easier to come back to.
		Instead of having a huge number of notes related to an specific area you should find connections between existing notes that are not necessary under the same "tag".
				By linking notes to other notes that have similar information or complementing information you can generate new, more polished notes
				
Use the big areas as [[Maps of content]]
