## Be flexible and open minded regarding direction
- Don't give attention only to the things that are related to the projects that are you currently working on.
	- You should [[seek and conquer opportunity]]
	- Many times we are scared to get out our comfort zone so we try to let anything that we are unfamiliar with slip by. In my opinion this in not a good approach because we might miss on important insight or on a great(maybe revolutionary) idea.
		- By being open minded I don't mean trying to learn everything and anything regardless the domain or the time and effort that we need to put in. I try to suggest that we would have a lot to benefit from being more receptive regarding the information that we encounter.
		- >Yes, we have to be selective, but not in terms of pros and cons, but in terms of relevant and irrelevant
