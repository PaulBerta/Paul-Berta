## Abstraction in learning 
- We often tend to jump to conclusions after we encounter something, especially if we find that resonates with our beliefs(This is the reason why "open minded people" tend have this problem more often).
	- The abstraction factor helps promoting a insight-creating attitude.
		- By putting an information in different contexts we may see different meanings and connections within the slip-box.
		- What is missing?
			- An example that I like is the one of the mathematician Abraham Wald. He was supposed to help the RAF(Royal Air force) find areas on they planes that were usually hit by bullets in order to reinforce them.
				- The mathematician told them to reinforce the parts which were not hit by bullets.
					- The RAF didn't take in account the planes that didn't return.
