## Stick to your systems
- If you committed to using a specific system, it means that you found it interesting and/or it was introduced to you by someone that you admire or believe.
	- At first it might feel odd or you might find it hard to "get the most out of it", but it gets better with time.
- By changing our systems to often we'll never get familiar with them, therefore we wont exploit them at their maximum potential.
	- Don't seek the perfect system because, as time goes by and you get to know a specific system, you notice its powers as well as its flaws/weaknesses, so you'll be able to adjust/change it in order to fit your needs.
	- Another question that you should ask is [[Do I enjoy this]]/ Can i stay consistent with this system for long periods of time?
